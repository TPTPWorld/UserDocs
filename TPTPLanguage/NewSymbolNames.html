<H1 ALIGN="LEFT">The TPTP Convention for New Symbol Names</H1>

This page describes the TPTP convention for the names of new symbols that are introduced by ATP 
systems when processing a TPTP problem.

<UL>
<LI> New non-variable symbol names are recommended to be of the form <TT>s</TT><EM>KN</EM>, 
     where <EM>K</EM> is an uppercase letter indicating the type of new symbol, and <EM>N</EM> 
     is a non-negative integer used to make the basic symbol name unique.
     <UL>
     <LI> The conventions for <EM>K</EM> are
          <UL>
          <LI> <TT>K</TT> for Skolems
          <LI> <TT>F</TT> for defined functions
          <LI> <TT>G</TT> for function symbols with other uses
          <LI> <TT>P</TT> for defined predicates
          <LI> <TT>Q</TT> for predicate symbols with other uses, e.g., for splitting
          </UL>
     <LI> The index <EM>N</EM> should be global across all symbol types, or local to each symbol 
          type.
     <LI> Examples: <TT>sK1</TT>, <TT>sF99</TT>, <TT>sP127</TT>.
     </UL>
<P>
<LI> New symbol names can optionally be extended by an underscore then one or more alphanumeric 
     and underscore characters.
     For examples, <TT>sK1_iProver</TT>, <TT>sF99_Splitting</TT>, <TT>sP127_3</TT>, 
     <TT>SV99_ForallIntro</TT>.
     The names should remain unique without the extension, using the <EM>N</EM> suffix.
<P>
<!--
<LI> New variable symbol names are recommended to be of the form <TT>SV</TT><EM>N</EM>, where
     <EM>N</EM> is a decimal number used to make the symbol name unique.
     (Thus the form mimics that form of new non-variable symbol names, but with an uppercase first 
     letter as dictated by the TPTP language.)
     For examples, <TT>SV1</TT>, <TT>SV99</TT>.
     The index <EM>N</EM> can be global across all formulae, or local to each formula.
<P>
-->
<LI> The introduction of new non-variable symbols should be recorded in a 
     <A HREF="https://tptp.org/UserDocs/TPTPLanguage/SyntaxBNF.html#new_symbol_record"><TT>
     &lt;new_symbol_record&gt;</TT></A> in the <TT>&lt;useful_info&gt;</TT> field of the
     <A HREF="https://tptp.org/UserDocs/TPTPLanguage/SyntaxBNF.html#inference_record">
     <TT>&lt;inference_record&gt;</TT></A> of a derived formula, or in the
     <TT>&lt;optional_info&gt;</TT> field of the
     <A HREF="https://tptp.org/UserDocs/TPTPLanguage/SyntaxBNF.html#internal_source">
     <TT>&lt;internal_source&gt;</TT></A> of an introduced formula.
     The new form will have the format
     <TT>new_symbols(</TT><EM>Type</EM><TT>,[</TT><EM>Symbols</EM><TT>])</TT>.
     The <EM>Type</EM> indicates the type of new symbol, with possible values
     <TT>skolem</TT>, <TT>definition</TT>, <TT>other</TT>.
     <EM>Symbols</EM> is a comma separated list of new symbols of that type.
     The <TT>&lt;useful_info&gt;</TT> field can have multiple <TT>new_symbols()</TT> terms.
     For examples,
<PRE>
    fof(50,plain,(
        ! [X3] : ~ hates(X3,sK1(X3)) ),
        inference(skolemize,[status(esa),new_symbols(skolem,[sK1]),skolemized(X4)],[49])).
    
    fof(64,definition,
        ( ~ sP1
      <=> ! [X8] : ~ has_job(X8,boxer) ),
        introduced(definition,[new_symbols(definition,[sP1])],[])).</PRE>
<P>
<LI> ATP systems should check for clashes whenever they generate a new symbol, and whenever 
     they read input after any new symbols have been generated.
</UL>
<P>
<EM>If you are interested in the history and motivations behind this convention, read the source 
of this web page.</EM>

<H2> Constraints and Requirements and Features </H2>

<OL>
<LI> A recommended, but not required, naming convention for new symbols 
     would help.
<LI> The recommendation must accomodate various types of new symbols,
     including Skolems, defined functions, defined predicates, and variables.
<LI> The recommended new symbol names should not open new name spaces, 
     which would require changes to the existing TPTP syntax.
     If the output from one system is to be used as input to other systems,
     then it is not possible to open a new name space for new symbol names.
     Thus new non-variable symbol names should start with lowercase and
     consist of only alphnumerics and underscore.
     Similarly, new variable symbol names should start with uppercase and
     consist of only alphnumerics and underscore.
<LI> If the recommended new non-variable symbol names are in the name space 
     of input symbols, then the recommended new symbol names should minimize 
     the possibility of clashes with input symbol names.
     <UL>
     <LI> The convention minimizes the possibility of clashes with input 
          non-variable symbol names - evidence for this is that no problem 
          in the TPTP has any lines that match 
          <TT>'[(, ] *s[A-Z][0-9]+(_[A-Za-z0-9_]+)?'</TT>.
     <UL>
<LI> New symbol names should be easy to recognize, by having an uncommon
     format.
     The naming convention has these features:
     <UL>
     <LI> New non-variable function symbols are easily found in formulae 
          using the regular expression
          <TT>'[(, ] *s[A-Z][0-9]+(_[A-Za-z0-9_]+)?'</TT>.
     </UL>
<LI> The recommended new symbol names should not have to be long or ugly, 
     for the sake of those who look at a lot of clauses and proofs.
     <UL>
     <LI> The convention's basic new symbol names are short.
     </UL>
<LI> It should be possible to annotate new symbol names, reflecting some extra meaning behind 
     the symbols, e.g., introduced via splitting, domain name as in finite interpretations, 
     system that introduced the name etc.
     <UL>
     <LI> The convention allows arbitrary annotation for particular applications.
     </UL>
<LI> It is necessary to check for clashes when a new symbol name is generated in an ATP system.
     If a clash occurs, options are:
     <UL>
     <LI> Report an error.
     <LI> Retrospectively rename the clashing generated symbol.
     <LI> Rename the clashing input symbol.
     </UL>
<LI> The introduction of new non-variable symbols should be documented in ATP systems' output.
</OL>
