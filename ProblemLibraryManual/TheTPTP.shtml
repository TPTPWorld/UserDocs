provide some overall statistics about the TPTP.
<P>
The problems in the TPTP are syntactically diverse, as is indicated by 
the ranges of the values in the tables.
The problems in the TPTP are also semantically diverse, as is indicated 
by the <A HREF="#DomainStructure">range of domains that are covered</A>. 
The problems are grouped into domains, covering topics in the fields of logic, 
mathematics, computer science, engineering, social sciences, arts and 
humanities, and others.
<P>
<STRONG>Sources</STRONG><BR>
The problems have been collected from various sources. 
Early sources were existing electronic problem collections and the ATP 
literature. 
Other sources include logic programming, mathematics, puzzles, and 
correspondence with ATP researchers.
Many people and organizations have contributed towards the TPTP:
the foundations of the TPTP were laid with David Plaisted's SPRFN collection;
many problems were taken from Argonne National Laboratory's ATP problem library 
(special thanks to Bill McCune here); Art Quaife provided several hundred 
problems in set theory and algebra; the Journal of Automated Reasoning, CADE 
Proceedings, and Association for Automated Reasoning Newsletters have provided 
a wealth of material; many problems have been provided by ATP users and
system developers (see the <A HREF="#Acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</A>).
<P>
<STRONG>Releases</STRONG><BR>
The TPTP is managed in the manner of a software product, in the sense that fixed releases are made.
Each release of the TPTP is identified by a release number, in the form 
<TT>v</TT><EM>Version</EM><TT>.</TT><EM>Edition</EM><TT>.</TT><EM>Patch level</EM>. 
The <TT>Version</TT> number enumerates major new releases of the TPTP, in which 
important new features have been added. 
The <TT>Edition</TT> number is incremented each time new problems are added to the current version. 
The <TT>Patch</TT> level is incremented each time errors, found in the current edition, are 
corrected. 
All non-trivial changes are recorded in a history file, as well as in the file for an affected 
problem.

<H3>The Domain Structure</H3>

This section provides the structure according to which the problems are grouped into domains. 
Some information about the domains is also given.
<P>
An attempt has been made to classify the totality of the TPTP problems in a systematic and natural 
way. 
The resulting domain scheme reflects the natural hierarchy of scientific domains, as presented 
in standard subject classification literature. 
The current classification is based mainly on the Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) 
[<A HREF="../../cgi-bin/SeeTPTP?Category=BibTeX&File=CB+89">CB+89</A>]
and the Mathematics Subject Classification (MSC) 
[<A HREF="../../cgi-bin/SeeTPTP?Category=BibTeX&File=MSC92">MSC92</A>]
used for the Mathematical Reviews by the American Mathematical Society.
Seven fields are defined: 
logic, mathematics, computer science, engineering, social sciences, arts and humanities, and other.
Each field contains further subdivisions, called <EM>domains</EM>. 
Each domain is identified by a three-letter mnemonic.
These mnemonics are also part of the TPTP 
<A HREF="#ProblemAndAxiomatizationNaming">problem naming scheme</A>.
The TPTP domains constitute the basic units of the classification. 
The full classification scheme is shown in 
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="#The Domain Structure of the TPTP">
The Domain Structure of the TPTP</A>,
and the numbers of abstract problems, problems, and generic problems
in each domain are shown in the TPTP document

     Combinatory logic is about applying one function to another.
     It can be viewed as an alternative foundation of mathematics (or, due to its 
     Turing-completeness, as a programming language).
     More formally, it is a system satisfying two combinators and satisfying reflexivity, symmetry,
     transitivity, and two equality substitution axioms for the function that exists implicitly for
     applying one combinator to another.<BR>

     Computing theory is a subfield of computer science dealing with theoretical issues such as 
     decidability (whether or not a given problem admits an algorithmic solution), completeness 
     (does an algorithm always find a solution if one exists?), correctness (are only solutions 
     produced?), and computational complexity (the resource requirements of algorithms).<BR>

     Commonsense reasoning is the branch of artificial intelligence concerned with replicating 
     human thinking. 
     There are several components to this problem, including:
     developing adequately broad and deep commonsense knowledge bases;
     developing reasoning methods that exhibit the features of human thinking, including
         the ability to reason with knowledge that is true by default,
         the ability to reason rapidly across a broad range of domains, and
         the ability to tolerate uncertainty in your knowledge;
     developing new kinds of cognitive architectures that support multiple reasoning methods and 
     representations.<BR>

<H3>Problem Versions and Standard Axiomatizations</H3>

There are often many ways to formulate a problem for presentation 
to an ATP system. 
Thus, in the TPTP, there are often alternative presentations of a problem. 
The alternative presentations are called <EM>versions</EM> 
of the underlying <EM>abstract problem</EM>. 
As the problem versions are the objects that ATP systems must deal
with, they are referred to simply as problems, and the
abstract problems are referred to explicitly as such. 
Each problem is stored in a separate physical file. 
In the TPTP the most coarse grain differentiation between problem versions
is whether the problem is presented in THF (with the subdivisions TH0 for
monomorphic logic and TH1 for polymorphic logic), TFF (with the subdivisions
TXF for extended logic (with the subdivisions TX0 for monomorphic logic
and TX1 for polymorphic logic), TF0 for monomorphic logic, and TF1 for
polymorphic logic), FOF, or CNF.
Within a given presentation, the primary reason for different versions of 
an abstract problem is the use of different axiomatizations. 
This issue is discussed below. 
A secondary reason is different formulations of the problem to be solved,
e.g., different clausal forms of a FOF problem.
<P>
<STRONG>Different Axiomatizations</STRONG><BR>
Commonly, many different axiomatizations of a theory exist.
By using different axiomatizations of a particular theory, different 
versions of a problem can be formed.
<P>
In the TPTP an axiomatization is <EM>standard</EM> if it is a 
complete axiomatization of 
an established theory, 
no lemmas have been added, and
it is not designed specifically to be suited or 
ill-suited to any ATP system, calculus, or control strategy.
A problem version is standard if it uses a standard axiomatization.
<! OLD The axiomatization must also be accepted within the community of human  >
<! OLD theorem proving systems for the domain. >
(Note: A standard axiomatization might be redundant, because some axioms are 
dependent on others. 
In general, it is not known whether or not an axiomatization is minimal, and thus the possibility 
of redundancy in standard axiomatizations must be tolerated.)
In the TPTP, standard axiomatizations are kept in separate axiom files, and are included in 
problems as appropriate. 
Sets of <EM>specialization</EM> axioms might be used to extend or constrain an axiomatization.
Specialization axioms are also kept in separate axiom files.
<P>
Within the ATP community, some problems have been created with <EM>non-standard</EM> 
axiomatizations. 
A non-standard axiomatization can be formed by modifying a standard axiomatization: the standard 
axiomatization can be <EM>reduced</EM> (i.e., axioms are removed) and the result is an 
<EM>incomplete</EM> axiomatization, or it can be <EM>augmented</EM> (i.e., lemmas are added) and 
the result is a <EM>redundant</EM> axiomatization. 
Incomplete and redundant axiomatizations are typically used to find a proof of a conjecture (based 
on the axiomatization) using a particular ATP system. 
An axiomatization can also be non-standard because it is <EM>biased</EM>, i.e., designed 
specifically to be suited or ill-suited to some ATP system, calculus, or control strategy.
A problem version is incomplete, redundant, or biased if its axiomatization is.
Finally, an axiomatization can be non-standard because it does not capture any established theory,
i.e., a standard axiomatization does not exist, but the axioms are not biased.
A problem version with such an axiomatization is <EM>especial</EM>.
Typically, the axioms in an especial problem are specific to that problem, and are not used in 
any other problem.
<P>
In any 'real' application of an ATP system, a standard or especial problem version would typically 
be used, at least initially. 
The use of standard axiomatizations is particularly desirable.

<P>
<A NAME="Equality Axiomatization">
<STRONG>Equality Axiomatization</STRONG><BR>
In the TPTP equality is represented in infix using <TT>=</TT> and <TT>!=</TT> for equality and 
inequality.
An inequality has the same meaning as a negated equality.
If equality is present in a problem, axioms of equality are not provided; it is assumed that 
equality reasoning is builtin to every ATP system.
If equality axioms are required by an ATP system they can be added using the <A HREF="#TPTP2X">
TPTP2X</A> or <A HREF="#TPTP4X">TPTP4X</A> utility.
If any axioms are added when the problems are submitted to an ATP system, then the addition must 
be <A HREF="#UsingTheTPTP">explicitly noted in reported results</A>/

<A NAME="ProblemGenerators">
<HR><!-- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<H3>Problem Generators</H3>

Some abstract problems have a generic nature, and particular instances of the abstract problem are 
formed according to some size parameter(s). 
An example of a generic problem is the N-queens problem: place N queens on a N by N chess board 
such that no queen attacks another.
The formulae for any size of this problem can be generated automatically, for any size of 
N&nbsp;&gt;=&nbsp;2.
Note that the <A HREF="#HeaderSection">problem status</A> might depend on the problem size.
<P>
Up to TPTP v1.1.3, the TPTP contained problem files for particular sizes of generic problems.
This, however, was undesirable.
Firstly, only a finite number of different problem sizes could be included, and therefore a 
desired size might have been missing. 
Secondly, even a small number of different problem sizes for each generic problem could consume a 
considerable amount of disk space.
To overcome these problems, the TPTP contains <EM>generator</EM> files.
Generator files are used to generate instances of generic problems, according to user supplied 
size parameters.
The generators are used in conjunction with the <A HREF="#TPTP2X">tptp2X utility</A>.
<P>
For convenience, the TPTP still contains, where they exist, interesting size instances of each 
generic problem. 
The <EM>TPTP sizes</EM> were chosen to be non-trivial,
The statistics in the TPTP documents take into account these instances of generic problems. 

<A NAME="ProblemAndAxiomatizationNaming">
<HR><!-- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<H3>Problem and Axiomatization Naming</H3>

Providing unambiguous names for all problems is necessary in a problem library.
A naming scheme has been developed for the TPTP, to provide unique, stable names for abstract 
problems, problems, axiomatizations, and generators. 
Files are assigned names according to the schemes depicted in 
Tables&nbsp;<A HREF="#Problem Naming">Problem Naming</A> and 
<A HREF="#Axiom Naming">Axiom Naming</A>.
The <TT>DDDNNN</TT> combination provides an unambiguous name for an abstract problem or 
axiomatization. 
The <TT>DDDNNNFV[.SSS]</TT> combination provides an unambiguous name for a problem or generator, 
and the <TT>DDDNNNFE</TT> combination provides an unambiguous name for a set of axioms. 
The complete file names are unique within the TPTP.
For example, the file <TT>GRP135-1.002.p</TT> contains the group theory problem number 
<TT>135</TT>, version number <TT>1</TT>, generated size <TT>2</TT>.
Similarly, the file <TT>CAT001-0.ax</TT> contains the basic category theory axiomatization 
number <TT>1</TT>.
<P>
A regular expression for recognizing problem file names is
"<TT>[A-Z]{3}[0-9]{3}[-+^=_][1-9][0-9]*(\.[0-9]{3})*\.p</TT>".
A regular expression for recognizing axiom file names is
"<TT>[A-Z]{3}[0-9]{3}[-+^=_][1-9][0-9]*\.ax</TT>".

This mechanism maintains the unique identification of problems and axiomatizations.

<A NAME="ProblemPresentation">
<HR><!-- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<H3>Problem Presentation</H3>

The physical presentation of the TPTP problem library is such that ATP researchers can easily use 
the problems. 
The syntax of all files is that of Prolog (with some operators defined).
This conformance makes it trivial to manipulate the files using Prolog. 
All information that is not for use by ATP systems is formatted as comments.
Comments extend from a <TT>%</TT> character to the end of the line, or may be block comments 
within <TT>/* ... */</TT> bracketing.

The TPTP file format, for problem files and axiom files, has three main sections. 
The first section is a header section that contains information for the user.
This information is not for <A HREF="#UsingTheTPTP">use by ATP systems</A>.
The second section contains <TT>include</TT> directives for axiom files. 
The last section contains the formulae that are specific to the problem or axiomatization.
TPTP generator files have three sections, different from the problem and axiom files.
The header section of generator files is similar to that of problem and axiom files, but with 
place-holders for information that is filled in based on the size of problem and the formulae 
generated. 
Following that comes Prolog source code to generate the formulae, and finally data describing the 
permissible sizes and the chosen TPTP size for the problem. 
More details are <A HREF="#ProblemGenerators">provided here</A>.
<P>
A <A HREF="../../cgi-bin/SeeTPTP?Category=Documents&File=SyntaxBNF">full BNF specification</A> of 
the problem and axiom file formats is provided in the <A HREF="#PhysicalOrganization">
<TT>Documents</TT> directory</A> of the TPTP.
The <A HREF="#TPTP2X">TPTP2X</A> and <A HREF="#TPTP4X">TPTP4X</A> utilities can be used to convert 
TPTP files to other known ATP system formats.
A description of the information contained in TPTP files is given below.
<P>
The problem files <TT>SYN000</TT>* are contrived to use most features of the TPTP language, and 
are thus suitable for testing parsers, etc.
They are not suitable for evaluating ATP systems' reasoning capabilities.

<A NAME="HeaderSection">
<H4>The Header Section</H4>

This section contains information about the problem, for the user. 
It is divided into four parts separated by blank lines. 
The first part identifies and describes the problem.
The second part provides information about occurrences of the problem in the literature and 
elsewhere.
The third part gives the problem's ATP status and a table of syntactic measurements made on the 
problem. 

The last part contains general information about the problem.
An example of a TPTP header, from the problem file <TT>GRP194+1.p</TT>, is shown in

<P>
<STRONG>The <TT>% File</TT> field.</STRONG><BR>
This field contains three items of information. 
The first item is the problem's name.
The current TPTP release number is given next, followed by the TPTP release 
in which the problem was released or last bugfixed (i.e., the formulae were 
changed). 
<P>
<STRONG>The <TT>% Domain</TT> field.</STRONG><BR>
The domain field identifies the <A HREF="#DomainStructure">domain</A>, and 
possibly a subdomain, from which the problem is drawn.
The domain corresponds to the first three letters of the problem name.
<P>
<STRONG>The <TT>% Problem</TT> field.</STRONG><BR>
This field provides a one-line, high-level description of the abstract problem. 
In axiom files, this field is called <TT>% Axioms</TT>, and provides a 
one-line, high-level description of the axiomatization.
<P>
<STRONG>The <TT>% Version</TT> field.</STRONG><BR>
This field gives information that differentiates this version of the problem 
from other versions of the problem. 
The first possible differentiation is the axiomatization that is used. 
If a specific axiomatization is used, a citation is provided. 
If the axiomatization is a pure equality axiomatization (uses only the 
<TT>equal</TT>/2 predicate) then this is noted too.
<P>
The second possible differentiation is the <A HREF="#ProblemVersions">
status of the axiomatization</A>.
There are 12 possiblities:
<UL>
<LI> <EM>empty</EM>. Indicates that the axiomatization is standard, i.e., it is 
     complete and has had no lemmas added (it might be redundant).
<LI> <TT>Especial</TT>. Indicates that the axiomatization does not capture any 
     established theory.
<LI> <TT>Biased</TT>. Indicates that the axiomatization is designed 
     specifically to be suited or ill-suited to some ATP system, calculus, 
     or control strategy.
<LI> <TT>Incomplete</TT>. Indicates that the axiomatization is incomplete.
<LI> <TT>Reduced > Complete</TT>. Indicates that a existing standard 
     axiomatization has had axioms removed, and the result is complete. 
     The existing axiomatization is necessarily redundant.
<LI> <TT>Reduced > Incomplete</TT>. Indicates that a existing standard 
     axiomatization has had axioms removed, and the result is non-standard 
     due to incompleteness.
<LI> <TT>Augmented</TT>. Indicates that a existing standard axiomatization has 
     had lemmas added, and the result is non-standard due to redundancy.
<LI> <TT>Reduced & Augmented &gt; Complete</TT>. Indicates that a existing 
     standard axiomatization has had axioms removed and lemmas added, and 
     the result is complete. 
<!  NOT IMPLEMENTED (would affect scripts, btw) >
<!  If the axiomatization is known to be non-standard due to redundancy,  >
<!  this is noted with <TT>(Non-standard)</TT> after <TT>Complete</TT>. >
<LI> <TT>Reduced & Augmented &gt; Incomplete</TT>. Indicates that a existing 
     standard axiomatization has had axioms removed and lemmas added, and 
     the result is non-standard due to incompleteness.
<LI> <TT>Incomplete &gt; Reduced &gt; Incomplete</TT>. Indicates that an 
     existing incomplete axiomatization has had axioms removed, and the 
     result is non-standard due to incompleteness.
<LI> <TT>Incomplete &gt; Augmented &gt; Complete</TT>. Indicates that 
     an existing incomplete axiomatization has had axioms added, and 
     the result is complete.
<LI> <TT>Incomplete &gt; Augmented &gt; Incomplete</TT>. 
     Indicates that an existing 
     incomplete axiomatization has had lemmas added, and the result is 
     non-standard due to incompleteness.
<LI> <TT>Incomplete &gt; Reduced & Augmented &gt; Complete</TT>. 
     Indicates that an 
     existing incomplete axiomatization has had axioms removed and lemmas 
     added, and the result is complete.
<!  NOT IMPLEMENTED (would affect scripts, btw) >
<!  If the axiomatization is known to be non-standard due to redundancy,  >
<!  this is noted with <TT>(Non-standard)</TT> after <TT>Complete</TT>. >
<LI> <TT>Incomplete &gt; Reduced & Augmented &gt; Incomplete</TT>. 
     Indicates that an 
     existing incomplete axiomatization has had axioms removed and lemmas 
     added, and the result is non-standard due to incompleteness.
<LI> <TT>Especial &gt; Reduced &gt; Especial</TT>.
     Indicates that an especial axiomatization has had axioms removed,
     and the result remains especial.
<LI> <TT>Especial &gt; Augmented &gt; Especial</TT>.
     Indicates that an especial axiomatization has had axioms added,
     and the result remains especial.

The third possible differentiation between problem versions is in the
theorem formulation. Variations in the theorem formulation are noted in
a <TT>Theorem formulation</TT> entry, e.g.,<BR>

<STRONG>The <TT>% Refs</TT> field.</STRONG><BR>
This field provides a list of abbreviated references for material in which 
the problem has been presented. 
Other relevant references are also listed.
The reference keys identify BibTeX entries in the <TT>Bibliography.bib</TT>
file supplied with the TPTP.
<P>
<STRONG>The <TT>% Source</TT> field.</STRONG><BR>
This field acknowledges the source of the problem, usually as a citation. 
If the problem was sourced from an existing problem collection then the 
collection name is given in <TT>[&nbsp;]</TT> brackets. 
The problem collections used thus far are:

<STRONG>The <TT>% Names</TT> field.</STRONG><BR>
Problems that have appeared in other problem collections or the literature, 
often have names which are known in the ATP community. 
This field lists such names for the problem, along with the source of the name. 
If the source is an existing problem collection then the collection name 
is cited, as in the <TT>% Source</TT> field.
If the source of a name is a paper then a citation is given. 
If a problem is not given a name in a paper then ``-'' is used as the known 
name and a citation is given.
Problems that first appeared in the TPTP have source TPTP, and no other name.
In generator files all known names for instances of the abstract
problem are listed, with the instance size given before the source.
A reverse index, from known names to TPTP names, is distributed with the TPTP.
<P>
<STRONG>The <TT>% Status</TT> field.</STRONG><BR>
This field gives the ATP status of the problem, according to the 
<A HREF="https://tptp.org/UserDocs/SZSOntology/">SZS ontology</A>.
For THF, TFF, and FOF problems it is one of the following values.
For THF problems the default semantics is Henkin with extensionality and choice.
If the status is different for other semantics, this is noted on lines after
the <TT>%&nbsp;Status</TT> field.
<UL>
<LI> <TT>Theorem</TT> - Every model of the axioms (and other non-conjecture
     formulae, e.g., hypotheses and lemmas), and there are some such models,
     is a model of all the conjectures.
<LI> <TT>ContradictoryAxioms</TT> - There are not models of the axioms (and 
     other non-conjecture formulae, e.g., hypotheses and lemmas).
<LI> <TT>CounterSatisfiable</TT> - Some models of the axioms (and there are 
     some) are models of the negation of at least one of the conjectures.
<LI> <TT>Unsatisfiable</TT> - There are no conjectures, and no interpretations
     are models of the axioms.
<LI> <TT>Satisfiable</TT> - There are no conjectures, and some interpretations
     are models of the axioms.
<LI> <TT>Unknown</TT> - The problem has never been solved by an ATP system.
<LI> <TT>Open</TT> - The abstract problem has never been solved.

For CNF problems it is one of:
<UL>
<LI> <TT>Unsatisfiable</TT> - No interpretations are models of the clauses.
<LI> <TT>Satisfiable</TT> - Some interpretations are models of the clauses.
<LI> <TT>Unknown</TT> - The problem has never been solved by an ATP system.
<LI> <TT>Open</TT> - The abstract problem has never been solved.
</UL>

<STRONG>The <TT>% Rating</TT> field.</STRONG><BR>
This field gives the difficulty of the problem, measured relative to
state-of-the-art ATP systems.
It is a comma separated list of ratings, each with a TPTP release number.
The rating is a real number in the range 0.0 to 1.0, where 0.0 means that all 
state-of-the-art ATP systems can solve the problem (i.e., the problem is easy), 
and 1.0 means no state-of-the-art ATP system can solve the problem (i.e., the 
problem is hard).
The rating is followed by a TPTP release number, indicating in which release 
the rating was assigned.
If no rating has been assigned, a <TT>?</TT> is given.
<P>
<STRONG>The <TT>% Syntax</TT> field.</STRONG><BR>
This field lists various syntactic measures of the problem's formulae. 
The measures for THF problems are:
<UL>
<LI> the numbers of formulae, unit formulae, type formulae, definition formulae,
<LI> the numbers of atoms, equality atoms, connective atoms,
<LI> the maximal and average number of atoms in a formula,

<STRONG>The <TT>% SPC</TT> field.</STRONG><BR>
This field indicates to which <EM>Specialist Problem Class</EM> (SPC) the problem belongs.
SPCs are sets of problems that have similar syntactic characteristics, so that that the problems 
are reasonably homogeneous with respect ATP systems' performances on the problems.
SPCs are used for caclulating the difficulty rating 
[<A HREF="../../cgi-bin/SeeTPTP?Category=BibTeX&File=SS01">SS01</A>], and 
for recommending systems to use on problems
[<A HREF="../../cgi-bin/SeeTPTP?Category=BibTeX&File=SS99-FLAIRS">SS99</A>].
The characteristics used to build the SPCs are:
<UL>
<LI> The form of the problem:
     <TT>TH1</TT>,
     <TT>TH0</TT>,
     <TT>TX1</TT>,
     <TT>TX0</TT>,

     <TT>OPN</TT> (open)
<LI> The effective order of the logic 
     (for <TT>FOF</TT> and <TT>CNF</TT> problems):
     <TT>PRP</TT> (propositional),
     <TT>EPR</TT> (effectively propositional),
     <TT>RFO</TT> (really first-order),
<LI> The amount of equality in the problem:
     <TT>EQU</TT> (with equality),

</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>The <TT>% Comments</TT> field.</STRONG><BR>
This field contains free format comments about the problem, e.g., the significance of the problem,
or the reason for creating the problem.
If the problem was created using the <A HREF="#TPTP2X">TPTP2X</A> utility then the TPTP2X 
parameters are given.
<P>
<STRONG>The <TT>% Bugfixes</TT> field.</STRONG><BR>
This field describes any bugfixes that have been done to the formulae of the problem.
Each entry gives the release number in which the bugfix was done, and attempts to pinpoint the 
bugfix accurately. 

<A NAME="IncludeSection">
<H4>The Include Section</H4>

The include section contains <TT>include</TT> directives for TPTP axiom files. 
An example extracted from the problem file <TT>GEO146+1.p</TT> is shown below.
<P>
<A NAME="IncludeSection">
<PRE>
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
%----Include simple curve axioms
include('Axioms/GEO004+0.ax').
%----Include axioms of betweenness for simple curves
include('Axioms/GEO004+1.ax').
%----Include oriented curve axioms
include('Axioms/GEO004+2.ax').
%----Include trajectory axioms
include('Axioms/GEO004+3.ax',[connect_defn,symmetry_of_at_the_same_time]).
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
</PRE>
<CENTER>
<U>Example of a problem file include section (adapted from <TT>GEO146+1.p</TT>).</U>
</CENTER>
<P>
Each of the <TT>include</TT> directives indicates that the formulae in the named file should be 
included at that point. 
Include files with relative path names are expected to be found either under the directory of the 
current file, or if not found there then under the directory specified in the <TT>TPTP</TT> 
environment variable.
If the <TT>include</TT> directive has a <TT>[]</TT>ed list of formulae names as a second argument,
the named file must be filtered to retain only those formulae (this filter also applies to formulae
that have been recursively included into the named file).
If any member of the list cannot be found, or there are multiple formulae with a given name, that
is an error condition.
If there is no second argument, or the second argument is <TT>all</TT>, then all the formulae in
the file are included.
In the example above only <TT>connect_defn</TT> and <TT>symmetry_of_at_the_same_time</TT> are
included from <TT>Axioms/GEO004+3.ax</TT>.
<P>
Full versions of TPTP problems (without <TT>include</TT> directives) can be created by using the
<A HREF="#TPTP2X">TPTP2X</A> and <A HREF="#TPTP4X">TPTP4X</A> utilities.
<P>
A side effect of separating out the axioms into axiom files is that the formula order in the TPTP
presentation of problems is typically different from that of any original presentation.
This reordering is acceptable because the performance of a decent ATP system should not be very
dependent on a particular formula ordering.
